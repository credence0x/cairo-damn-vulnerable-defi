## Play

Visit [damnvulnerabledefi.xyz](https://damnvulnerabledefi.xyz).<br>
Note that this is an adaptation of the original set of challenges, which were written in Solidity, so you would have to use this repository to complete the challenges in Cairo.

## Setup 
Install Cairo compiler `v2.0.1`<br>
See https://github.com/franalgaba/cairo-installer<br>
<br>
Install Scarb version `0.5.1`.<br>
See https://github.com/software-mansion/asdf-scarb (recommended) and https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb <br>
To confirm installation, run `$ scarb --version` which should output

```
scarb 0.5.1 (798acce7f 2023-07-05)
cairo: 2.0.1 (https://crates.io/crates/cairo-lang-compiler/2.0.1)
```
To test your solution, run `scarb test` .
